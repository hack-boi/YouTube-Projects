## :zap: Description 📃

It's an amazing game which include all kinds of stuff which our hero box can do on platform like moving left,right and can also move forward and backward on our platform. Our box can also jump if the avoidance to our villain cube becomes difficult. It's using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Three.js Library.


## :zap: How to run it? 🕹️

- There will be 2 types of 3d boxes of color red and green. Red is for danger and green will be our moving block. So we have to avoid all the red boxes and keep the green box on the platform and go as far as we can... It's an amazing game and will really be fun to make.
- The player can save his box by clicking left, right and can also use up and down arrow to move our box forward and backward respectively. The user can also use mouse to see the platform from the different angles so that he can get a 3D experience.
