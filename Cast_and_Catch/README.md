## :zap: Description 📃

The Fishing Game is a simple and addictive game where the player tries to catch fish using a fishing hook. The player's goal is to catch as many fish as possible within a given time limit or until a certain score is reached. It tests the player's timing and reflexes as they try to hook the fish swimming in the pond.


## :zap: How to run it? 🕹️

The game starts with a pond background image and a fishing hook positioned at the bottom center of the pond.
Fish of different sizes and types swim randomly in the pond.

- The player can control the fishing hook using mouse clicks.
- If the hook overlaps with the fish, the player scores points, and the caught fish is removed from the pond.
- If the hook misses the fish, no points are scored.
- The game continues for a certain duration.
- The player's score is displayed on the screen during the game.
- After the game ends, the player can restart the game to play again.
